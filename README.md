# CROPSPRICEPREDICTION
We have uploaded All our ML related Work in our Jupyter Notebook.
All The Datasets used Have Been uploaded in Data Folder
All the trained models are stored in Models Folder.
Django-Site Work in hackathon.
Main Focus of Our Work is Our Data Collection, Parameters we choose, and our commitment to predict prices on monthly base.
We have chosen a set of Parameters Which meet a real world scenario.
We have Done Regression in Places, where Errors were less(Since It's Impossible to find data Online that can be applied on Each Cereals), and in other cases we have Done Classification(Using RandomForestClassifier(As Data was Apt for it)),in which we obtain accuracy score of at least 80% accuracy, in what ever, three values we choose for classification,(a,b,c) with classification as(>A,<B and >A,<A,>B),(However label output will be different for different Models i.e. it can be (A,B,C,D) or (A+,A,B+,B) etc)
